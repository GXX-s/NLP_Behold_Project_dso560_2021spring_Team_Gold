# NLP_Behold_Project_dso560_2021spring_Team_Gold
This is the final group project for dso560 NLP, partnered with Behold. Behold would like to partner with USC’s DSO560 NLP class to develop a recommendation system that is based on the retail fashion brand’s brand descriptive information.

## This project is aimed at 2 goals:

1. Create a machine learning model to classify brands for Behold products based on product descriptions.
2. Create a brand recommender algorithm that would recommend an outfit given a customer's search query. This algorithm can be simply a Python function. 

We have 4 jupyternotebooks to document our working process and code.

2. Model Exploration --> output file: 
3. Final Model for brand classification
